### Hi there, I am Paula! 👋🏾👩🏾‍💻

![](https://github.com/paulapereda/paulapereda/blob/master/paula_pereda_clouds_women_thoughts.png)

I live in Washington, D.C. I am Uruguayan and come from Montevideo, which is my hometown. I have a BSc in Economics from the [Facultad de Ciencias Económicas y Administración](http://fcea.edu.uy/maestrias/maestria-economia.html) of the Universidad de la República, and I am an advanced candidate for an MSc in Economics from the Universidad de Montevideo. I am involved in the Uruguayan R community: both in [R-Ladies](https://twitter.com/RLadiesMVD), a [global organization](https://rladies.org/) whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community, as co-organizer of the Montevideo chapter, and in the [Uruguay R Users Group](https://twitter.com/gurumvd). I work as a Leading Research Assistant at DIME, World Bank (Washington D.C.), on the project "Climate and  Resilience Impact Evaluation Window: Experimental Evidence from Four Countries (Mali, Niger, Rwanda & South Sudan)".


📌 My main topics of interest are economic gender gaps and their mechanisms, early childhood development, and scientific communication, with particular emphasis on compelling data visualizations.

In addition to being particularly obsessed with microeconometrics and R, I am a huge Taylor Swift fan (which can be [checked out here](https://paulapereda.com/2021/01/07/taylor-analisis-de-texto-sobre-la-discografia-de-taylor-swift-en-r/)), and I enjoy doing [programming projects](https://paulapereda.com/portfolio/), writing [dissemination articles](https://paulapereda.com/), drawing and painting!
